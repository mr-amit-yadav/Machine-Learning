# Machine-Learning
This repository contains practical implementations of various Machine Learning algorithms. The goal is to demonstrate a hands-on understanding of how these models work and how to apply them to datasets.

## 🚀 Algorithms Implemented

### 📈 Regression
* **Simple Linear Regression:** Predicting a continuous value based on a single feature.
* **Multiple Linear Regression:** Predicting outcomes using multiple independent variables.
* **Polynomial Regression:** Modeling non-linear relationships.

### ⚖️ Regularization Techniques
* **Lasso Regression (L1):** Feature selection and preventing overfitting.
* **Ridge Regression (L2):** Reducing model complexity.
* **Elastic Net:** A hybrid of Lasso and Ridge.

### 📊 Classification
* **Logistic Regression:** Binary and multi-class classification.
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Instance-based learning.
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** High-dimensional classification.
* **Decision Trees:** Tree-based logic for classification/regression.
* **Naive Bayes:** Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn
